This Repository is an Example of using Airsim with Deep Q Learning for Reinforcement learning. 

Requirements:

AirSim-1.2.

UnrealEngine-4.18.

Tensorflow.



Using learned weights:

Use main-deploy.py for testing the Agent. The agent tries to find a fixed goal (white cone) from a fixed staring point.


Training from scratch:

Use main.py for training from scratch.
